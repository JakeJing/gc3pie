GC3Pie is a suite of Python classes (and command-line tools built upon
them) to aid in submitting and controlling batch jobs to clusters and
grid resources seamlessly.  GC3Pie aims at providing the building
blocks by which Python scripts that combine several existing
applications in a dynamic workflow can be quickly developed.

There is a need in some scientific communities, to run large job
campaigns to analyze a vast number of data files with the same
(pre-existing) application. The single-job level of control exposed by
many existing Grid computing middlewares in this case is not enough: a
user would have to implement "glue scripts" to control hundreds or
thousand jobs at once.  GC3Pie has provisons for this, in the form of
re-usable Python classes that implement a single point of control for
job families; it also has support for some popular scientific
applications, but more can be added by subclassing the generic
``Application`` object.

This talk will survey the features and services offered by GC3Pie, and
show how these have been used in a number of real-life scientific use
cases.
